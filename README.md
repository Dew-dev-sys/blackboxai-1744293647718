## Features
- **Rich Content Creation**: Write blog posts, upload videos, share music, and more.
- **Multi-Author Support**: Collaborate with other creators and build your audience together.
- **Multimedia Support**: Share photos, videos, music, e-books, and PDFs in one place.

## Dependencies
For the styling and interactive components, Rambling Vile uses the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Version linked through a CDN, providing utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used throughout the platform.
- **Google Fonts**: Utilizes Poppins and Playfair Display for typography.

These dependencies are included via their respective CDNs in the `index.html`. There is no need for a package manager or additional dependencies if you are directly using the HTML file.

## Project Structure
The main structure of the project is as follows:

```
/rambling-vile

└─── index.html         # Main entry point for the platform
```

The `index.html` contains all necessary markup, styles, and scripts to run the blog platform directly in a web browser.
